# # E-commerce Back End Starter Code

* AS A manager at an internet retail company
* I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
* SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies


* GIVEN a functional Express.js API

* WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
* THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
* WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
* THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
* THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
* THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
* THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
